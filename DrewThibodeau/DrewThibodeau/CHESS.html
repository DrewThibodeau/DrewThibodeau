    Chess and I go all the back to kindergarten where I first picked up the game and decided to stick with my elementary and middle school team every year until high school.  When I got into high school I did take a two year break but by the time I became a junior I missed challenge.  Now I still play with my friends and I plan on joining the UMaine chess club soon.
