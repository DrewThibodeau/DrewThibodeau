    An Informative Essay about Me
</h1>
<p >
    Hello my name is Drew Thibodeau and I am a freshman in my second semester here at UMaine.  I just recently had my nineteenth birthday on the first day back to school on January twenty second.  I currently reside in my hometown of Orrington and commute each day to and from school.  Iâ€™ve worked for a hotel in Bangor called the Rodeway Inn since it was legal for me to be employed there and just got done last November do to layoffs.  As a replacement I have become a Calculus tutor here at UMaine.

    For my first semester I was enrolled as an Electrical Engineering student but before the first day of class I was a business major.  Starting from the beginning I was a business major because I was lead to enroll UMaine as that.  After attending some events and meetings that showed what you would be doing for your degree I decided to change to the more difficult major of Electrical Engineering.  After completing a semester of Electrical Engineering I had learned a lot about college and myself, in particular I realized the best parts of that semester were not when I was learning about circuits but when I was learning how the circuits could be put to use.  I came to the conclusion that while I enjoyed my time in Engineering, it was not for me but instead I wanted to work with numbers and people.  Specifically I wanted to help people with numbers and after some paperwork and meetings with a bunch of offices I became enrolled in the double major of Finance and Financial Economics in order to become a financial adviser.  This is also the reason I signed up to become a Calculus tutor with the added benefits of getting paid and working on my teaching skills.

    Finally I would like to tell you about my high school career.  I was a standard B minus student with motivation issues in class.  Outside of class however I participated in many extracurriculars including: chess, math, cyber-defense, and robotics teams.  In chess and robotics team I was a team leader and partial coordinator of meetings between the coaches and students.  A major theme in my life with clubs and academics is I have always enjoyed helping others and dealing with numbers and I am glad that I can pursue this further as a career at UMaine.
