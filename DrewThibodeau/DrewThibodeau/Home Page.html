        Welcome To My Webpage
    </h1>
    <p >
        Hello and thank you for visiting my website I made for my Information Systems and Technology for Business course.  Here I would like to introduce myself in three main parts.  Fortunately I recently wrote a bit about myself and I feel it does a good job nailing down the basic information so I'll leave that
        <a href="MeEssay.html">Here.</a>
        In my senior of high school I had the pleasure of going on a trip to Europe which was probably the most interesting thing to happen in recent memory and you can see more about it by clicking
        <a href="Vacation.html">Here.</a>
        A common way to find information about someone is to Google them and if you did with my first and last name a picture of myself much younger playing chess would show up and that is quite fitting as chess is something I have been invovled with enough that I am glad it is how I'm documented.  For more on my history with chess click
        <a href="CHESS.html">Here.</a>

As a final note, I have the picture I look the best in, and it just so happens I'm holding the youngest member of my family, my cousin Hayden.
