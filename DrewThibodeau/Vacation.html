    <p>The trip I went on was through my high school, it lasted two weeks, and went through parts of both England and France.  I have a lot of amazing memories about my time over there and I'd love to go back soon.  Some highlights were seeing my best friend since kindergarten make his promposal to another close friend in front of the Eiffel Tower,  eating escargot or snails for the first time, seing Les Miserables performed in London, and all the amazing buildings in almost every part of all the places we stopped.  Overall I had an amazing time overseas and if I could share more of the experience than just these following photos I would.</p>
